<span class = "italics">HERE</span> as manye histories of olde
&amp; auncient antiquitie, and
also al godly &amp; Christiã writers most playnely consêt
together, and agree in this, that dignitie, riches, kinred,
worldly pompe, and renoume, doo neither make men better, ne
yet happiar, contrarie too the blynde &amp; fonde iudgement of
the most part of menne: but by the power and strength of the
mynde, that is, learnyng, wysedome,
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>and vertue, all
menne are hyghly enriched, ornated, &amp; most purely beutified,
for these bee thinges bothe notable, eternall, and verye
familiar betwene the heauenly father &amp; vs. It is therefore
euidente (most excellent Prince) that the fittest ornamêtes
for your graces tender age, bee, eruditiõ and vertue.
Wherunto you are bothe so ernestly addicte and therin so
wõderfully doo preuaile, that I nede not too exhorte &amp;
exstimulate your grace vnto the study thereof. For that God
him self hath wrought, and fourmed your mynde so apt and
desirous too attayne and diligêtly too seeke for al godly
doctrine, that euê now you doo shewe in all youre saiynges
and dooinges suche a wonderfull pleasaûtes much lyke vnto a
certayne swete musike or harmonie, that any honest hart
exceadinglye woulde reioyce in the sight therof. Verely,
your grace thinketh plainly all time lost, that is not
bestowed vpon learnyng, which is a verie rare thyng in anye
childe, and rarest of all in a Prince. Thus youre noblenes,
rather desireth vertue and
<span class = "pagenum">A.iii.</span>learning the most
surest and excellent treasures, which farre surmounte all
worldly ryches, then anye vanities or trifles. Nowe youre
grace prepareth for the holsome and pleasaunt foode of the
mynde. Now you seke for that whiche you shal fynd most
surest helper and faythfulst councellour in all your
affaires. Now your magnificêt mynde studieth that, whiche
all Englyshe menne with meke and humile heartes shuld desire
GOD to endue your grace with all. Now with diligent labour
you searche for a thyng, as one most myndeful of this
saiyng: Happy is that realme that hath a lerned Prince. Nowe
you trauaile for that, whiche conquereth, and kepeth doune
all greuous tourmentes &amp; outragious affections of the mynde,
too the furderaunce of good liuyng, and maintenaûce of
vertue, I meane holsome erudition and learnyng. Many Heathen
Princes forsoth, are highly magnified with most ample
prayses, which gaue them selues too the study of
Philosophie, or knowledge of tongues, for their owne
commoditie, and
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>especially
for the weale of their
subiectes. Who is nowe more celebrated and worthelier
extolled then Mithridates? that noble kyng of Pont and
Bithinia, which, (as Aulus Gellius writeth) vnderstoode so
perfitly the languages of .xxii. sondrye countries that were
vnder his dominiõ, that he neuer vsed any interpretour too
answer his subiectes, but spake their lãguages so finelye,
as thoughe he had been of the same coûtrie. Ageyn, that
honorable manne Quintus Ennius saied: that he had .iii.
heartes, because he coulde speake Greke, Italian, and Latin.
Yea, and breuely, the most famaus writers, as well the
Heathen, as the Christien, with an vniuersall consent,
playnly affirme: Whan thei had weied the nature and condiciõ
of the purest thinges vnder heauen, thei sawe nothyng faire,
or of any pryce, or that ought too be accõpted ours, but
onely vertue and learning. Euen now too acknowledge that
same, it is yeouê you from aboue, for your grace delecteth
in nothyng more then too bee occupied in the holye Byble:
wherin, <span class = "pagenum">A.iiii.</span>you beginne
too sauer &amp; smelle furth the
treasure of wisedome, knowledge and fulnes of the deuyne
power, that is a studie most conuenient for euery Christien
Prince, that kynd of studye cannot haue sufficient laude and
commendation. Whose Princely heart forsoth, is raueshed on
suche a godlie and vertuous studie, it can neuer haue
condigne and worthie praises, but deserueth alwaies too bee
had in great price, estimation, and honour. Who dooeth not
know? that Prince which is yeouen vnto the scriptures of God
and with a stoute stomake and valiãt heart, both searcheth
furth and also defendeth y<sup>e</sup> true doctrine of the Gospell,
too bee inrolled in the assemble of Christ. Who dooeth not
see? that Prince too bee moost surelye armed, which carieth
in his heart the swerd of y<sup>e</sup> spirit, which is the blessed
woord of God. Who is ignoraunt? that euer lastyng lyfe
consisteth in the knoweledge of God. What Prince woulde not
studie to maintaine that, which is written for the health,
and saluation of all menne weiyuge with himselfe
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>that a
Prince can not deserue, neither by conquest, ciuel policie,
nor yet by anye other meane vnder heauen, thys name high or
honorable, so wourthely as by the setting forward of Goddes
woorde. What young Prince humily defendyng doune intoo him
selfe and callyng to memory his bounden dutie woulde not
with a glad hearte and a chearfull mynde, gredelye desyre
too knowe, enlarge, and amplifie the glory and maiestie of
hys derely beloued father? Your grace (forsoth) hath
professed God too bee your father: Blessed are you then if
you obey vnto hys word, and walke in his waies. Blessed are
you, yf you supporte suche as preache the Gospell. Blessed
are you, yf your mind bee full furnished with the testament
of Christ, and shew your selfe too bee the most cruel too
and enemy agaynst ypocrisie, supersticion, and all
papistical phantasies, wherw<sup>t</sup> the true religion of God
hathe been dusked and defaced these many yeres Blessed are
you, if you reade it daye &amp; nighte, that your grace maye
knowe what GOD dooeth forbyd you, and
<span class = "pagenum">A.v.</span>euer submit
your selfe therunto with seruiceable lowlines chiefly
desiring to florysh and decke your mynd with godly
knowledge. And most blessed are you, if you apply your self
vnto al good workes, &amp; plant surely in your heart the
scriptures of Christ, If you thus doo, nether the power of
any papistical realme, nor yet of hel can preuaile at any
time against your grace. Nowe therfore, with humile hearte,
faithfully receiue the swete promises of the Gospel. If you
kepe the woordes of the Lorde and cleaue fast vnto them:
there is promised you the kingdome of heauen: You are
promised a weale publick most riche and welthy You are
promised too bee deliuered from the deceiptes of all youre
priuie enemyes. You are promised also, too conquere great
and mightie nations. Agayne, let your grace bee most fully
perswaded in this, that ther was neuer Kyng nor Prince, that
prospered whiche tooke parte against Goddes woord, and that
the greatest abhomination that can bee, either for Kyng,
Prince, or any other manne, is too
for<span class = "pagenum">|</span>sake the true
woord of God. O with howe rebukefull woordes &amp;amp; greuous
iudgement thei be condemned, which dispice &amp; set lytle by
the holy Byble &amp; most
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'bessed'">blessed</ins>
Testamêt of God, wherin there
is contained all the wil &amp; pleasure of our heauêly father
toward vs most miserable &amp; ignoraunt wretches Who would not
quake, too beholde the terrible feares &amp; threatenynges of
God ageinst al suche? Who would not lament &amp; gladly helppe
their obstinate blyndenes? Who woulde not weepe? to heare
and reade in how many places, they be openly accursed by the
scriptures of Christ. God him self playnely affirmeth, that
he wyll sodênly consume them with the breath of his anger.
Yea, besides that whoso euer declyneth from the word of God
is accursed in all his doynges, whether he be Kyng, or
Prynce, riche, or poore, or of what estate soeuer he bee.
This fearfull saiyng (most excellent Prynce) shulde moue all
men to take hede vnto their duties and to praie that gods
word maie take place emõgist vs. O that al men would
fanta<span class = "pagenum">|</span>sie the scriptures of God,
and saye w<sup>t</sup> the vertuous man
Iob. Wee will not bee ageynst the woordes of the holy one.
Truth it is, God taketh diligent care too haue vs al know
his woord. Woulde God therfore, that all wee were now
willing to haue the syncere woorde of God &amp; all holsom
doctrine too go forward. O that all we would consent
togither in the Gospell, brotherly admonishyng, and
secretelye prouokyng one an other too true religion &amp;
vertue. O that no man would sow emongist the people
pernitious doctryne, but with all lowly diligêce and Godlye
monition euer prouoke, tempt, and stere them, tyll their
heartes were remoued frõ their olde dautyng dreames and
supersticiõ, which haue been long grafted in them thorow
popyshe doctrine. By this meane wee shuld euer haue concorde
emongist vs, whiche in all thynges is necessary, but most
nedefull and expedient in Gods holi woord. Now truely the
godlyest thynge that can bee deuysed, for any christian
realme, is to haue emongist them one maner and
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>fourme
of doctryne, &amp; too trace trueli the steppes of God and neuer
to seeke any other bywayes. Who hath not redde in y<sup>e</sup>
scriptures? but that realme is endued with godly ornamentes
&amp; riches, where all men prospere, go for ward and florishe
in gods woord, delectyng day and night in the swete
cõsolations of the holy testament. By this way we shuld
especially set forth the glory of God, and of our sauiour
Iesu Christ, if we would reuerently shew one an other that
whiche God hath taught vs. Yea &amp; in this doyng all men
shulde well perceaue that we were the true disciples of
Christ, being knitte and coupled fast together in mynde and
iudgement, preachyng God with one mouth and also with one
assent euer promotyng his gloryous testament. O the good
happe and grace of that king or prynce emongist whose
subiectes there is such an hole consent and iudgement in the
woord of God, for y<sup>t</sup> most assuredly byndeth &amp; adiuigneth
y<sup>e</sup> hartes of al subiectes too their kyng. The strength of
the Gospell is euen suche in this puincte,
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>that there
was neuer man, which did humily receaue it, that would
murmour ageynst his Prince. It teacheth how wyllyngly all
men shulde obey their kyng. It sheweth verye lyuely and most
apertly vnto euery man his ful dutie. It euer prouoketh vs
from all wicked, cursed, and most obstinate disobedience. It
euer instructeth men too shewe them selues most lowly,
humile, and obesaunt toward their Prynce. Whosoeuer hath
tasted fully therof, will declare hym selfe in al thynges,
too bee a faithful subiect. Furthermore, it is clearer then
the light (most vertuous prince) that it woulde make muche
for the weale of this noble realme, yf all mê with heart and
mynde, would nowe as well expulse the pernitious and
deuelyshe doctryne af that Romishe bishop, as his name is
blotted î bookes. There is none so ignoraunt, but he knoweth
that, thorough hym we were brought into a wõderful blindnes,
thorough hym we did sauer of nothyng, but of stynkyng
Ydolatry, through hym we were deceiued with
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>false
Ypocrisie. Now let euery blind stiffe hearted, and obstinate
creature compare his abhomination with the gospell, and if
he be not shameles, he will abashe to smell of his
papistrie, and to walow still in ignoraunce, vn lest he bee
priuely confederate and in heart consent with the detestable
felowship of al wicked papistes. Now would God all suche men
would reduce ageyn their heartes vnto y<sup>e</sup> gospell of
Christ, would god they would bee prouoked by some meane to
desire knowledge. O that god woulde yeoue them a couragious
mynde too reade the gospel, there they shal sone fynde all
the venoume of the romishe sort most playnely detected.
Forsoth wee see dayly, y<sup>t</sup> lacke of knowledge of the gospel
maketh some busserdes runne hedlong on all rockes, daungers,
&amp; extreme perilles: yea, and beside that, olde popysh
doctryne whiche lyeth folded vp &amp; locked faste in their
heartes, doeth so sore blynd thê that they haue neither
fauour ne affectiõ too printe in their myndes, the expressed
coûcels, admonitions, and
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>preceptes of the holy
scripture, but too slepe stil in their owne conceites,
dreames, &amp; fonde phansies. Wherfore let your dignitie note
well this, that all those whiche bee not wyllyng y<sup>t</sup> gods
woord should bee knowen, and that blyndenes should be clean
expulsed from all men, whiche be baptised in y<sup>e</sup> blessed
bludde of Christ, bewray themselues playne papistes: for in
very deede that most deceatful wolfe and graund maister
papist with his totiens quotiens, and a pena et culpa
blesseth all suche as will bee blynde stil, maintaine his
põpe, drinke of his cuppe of fornication, trust in his
pardounes, liue in popery, ypocrisie, and dãnable ydolatrie,
shut vp the kingdome of heauen, &amp; neuer regarde the gospel.
Cõtrarie too this, christ bi his holy Prophete calleth al
those blessed y<sup>t</sup> seke for his testimonies, al those his
elect &amp; chosê childrê, which turne frõ synne, ypocrisie, &amp;
ydolatrie, all those goddes y<sup>t</sup> heare his word, yea, &amp;
breuely, al those which set it forward honorable mê. &amp; in
this puincte your grace shoulde euer beare in mynde,
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>that noble and
vertuous kyng Hezekiah, whiche shewed
hymselfe very honorable in settîg forward ye woord of God,
and therby gotte hym glory and fame immortall, so that nowe
he is most highly praysed amongtst all men. Ageyn his
subiectes dyd obey his commaundement feynedly with
Ypocrisie, but in their heartes they abhorred gods woord.
O&nbsp;the miserie that dyd afterwarde sodeinly ensue vpon them,
O&nbsp;the wonderfull wrath of God that was poured vpon them,
O&nbsp;their great and obstinate blindnes whiche caused them most
greuously too be scourged: Their plage was no lesse then too
bee vtterly spoyled of their enemies, Their plage was no
lesse then to eate one an other: Yea, their plage was no
lesse then to eate their owne sonnes and doughters. This
calamitie and sorow (most noble prynce) happened them
because they dyd not regarde the lawes of God, but tourned
too their olde abhominable Ydolatrie, and lightelye estemed
gods holy woord. Wherfore euen now whosoeuer is an enemie
<span class = "pagenum">B.i.</span>to the holy Bible,
that is, neither studiyng it
himselfe, nor willyng that other men shulde knowe it, he can
in no wyse be a right christian man: although he fast, pray,
doo almes, &amp; all the good workes vnder heauen. And he that
hath suche a mynde, is y<sup>e</sup> most cursed and cruel enemie too
god, a playne sower of sedition, and a deuelishe disquieter
of all godly men. For truly those that reade the gospel of
Christ, and labour diligêtly therin: doo fynde wonderfull
rest &amp; quietnes, from all woofull miserie, perturbatiõ, and
vanities of this world. And surely none but ypocrites or els
deuilles would go about too stoppe or allure men from suche
a treasure and godly study. And it were conuenient, that all
they whiche wyll remayne styll necligent, styffe, &amp; blind:
shuld set before their faces the feare of paynes infernall,
and if thei haue any grace at all, their spirites ought to
be moued: too note the great plages that haue happened the
slouthful in gods woord, &amp; those that haue been stubburne
ageynst the settyng
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>out of it. There bee a thousand
recordes and examples in the holy Bible agaynst such as be
farre wyde from knowledge, and lye now walteryng styl in
ignoraunce and will not looke vpon the bible. It woulde
seme, they hope for a thyng, but their hope is in vaine: For
saint Paule plainely writeth the hope of suche ypocrites
shall coom<sup>n</sup> too nought. And too conclude (most honorable
Prince) seeyng wee haue suche knowledge opened vnto vs, as
neuer had englishe mê, and are clearly deliuered from the
snares and deceiptes of al false and wicked doctrine, if we
shuld not now thãkefully receaue the gospell, and shewe our
selues naturally enclyned to set it forwarde, yea, and pray
daye and night vnto God, for the preseruatiõ and health of
the kynges highnes, your graces deare, and most entierly
beloued father, we were neither true subiectes nor ryght
christen men. Forsoth, through the absolute wisedome, and
the most godly and politike prudencie of his grace, the
swete sounde of gods woorde is gone
tho<span class = "pagenum">B.ii.</span>rough out
all this realme, the holye Bible and blessed testament of
oure sauiour Christ are coom<sup>n</sup>ne to lighte, and thousandes
haue faithfully receiued those pleasaunt, ioyfull, and most
comfortable promises of God. Surely this thyng before all
other, is acceptable too god. This thyng especially swageth
y<sup>e</sup> ire of god. This thyng in all holi scriptures god most
chiefly requireth of his elect &amp; faithfull seruaûtes, euen
too haue his lytell flocke knowe his blessed woorde, whiche
woulde bee muche better knowê &amp; more thankefulli receaued,
yf al agees and degrees of men with one mynd, wyll, &amp; voice,
would nowe drawe after one lyne, leauyng their owne priuate
affections, and shewe theim selues euer vigilant, prompt, &amp;
ready helpers &amp; workers with God, (accordynge to the
councell of sainct Paule) &amp; especially priestes,
scolemaisters &amp; parêtes, which accordyng too y<sup>e</sup> Prophete
Dauid are blessed, if they gladly requite y<sup>e</sup> lawe of God.
They shuld therfore reade y<sup>e</sup> bible &amp; purdge theyr mindes
of al papistry: for theyr
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>necligence, in dooyng their
duties &amp; slugishnes toward y<sup>e</sup> blessed woord of god, dooeth
too muche appere. Through them forsoth the gospel of Christ
shuld bee most strongely warded and defended, for almost all
the Prophetes, and a great parte of the scripture beside
teache them their duties, and shew playnely what maner of
men they shulde bee: Yea, and how greuously the holy
Prophetes crie out vpon false and ignoraunt priestes, the
thyng is very euident. But through the helppe of God all
those that be ignoraunt, or els learned (as they take them
selues) wyll leaue of, and repent them of their wicked and
obstinate blyndnes, and bowe them selues with all
oportunitie too draw mens heartes too the holy testament of
God: consideryng, y<sup>t</sup> in the terrible day of iudgement,
euery mã shall yeoue accompte of his Beliwicke, where
neither ignoraûce shall excuse vs, ne yet any worldly põpe
may defêd vs. Most happye thê shall they bee, whiche haue
walked iustely in the sight of the Lorde, and
<span class = "pagenum">B.iii.</span>that
haue syncerely preached his testament and lyuely woord
withoute flattery or iuggelyng: Yea, and in y<sup>t</sup> fearful
day, all they (as writeth S. Augustine) shal fynde mercie at
the handes of god, whiche haue entised and allured other
vnto goodnes and vertue. Weiyng this with my self, (most
excellent, and vnto all kynd of vertues most prõpt &amp; prestãt
Prince) I thought it good too translate this Dialoge, called
the Epicure, for your grace: whiche semed too me, too bee
very familiar, &amp; one of y<sup>e</sup>
godliest Dialoges y<sup>t</sup> any mã
hath writtê in y<sup>e</sup> latin tong. Now therfore I most humili
praie, y<sup>t</sup> this my rude &amp; simple trãslation may bee
acceptable vnto your grace, trustyng also y<sup>t</sup> your most
approued gentilnes, wil take it in good part. There as I doo
not folow y<sup>e</sup> latyn, woord for woord, for I omytte y<sup>t</sup> of

Yea, but <span class = "roman">Marcus Tullius</span> nameth y<sup>t</sup> the ende of

<span class = "speaker">HED.</span> That is a worke of very great

preuailed in any thîg there, whereby you haue the
ra<span class = "pagenum">|</span>ther come too the knowledge of the truth?<br>
<span class = "speaker">SPE.</span> I
haue had such fruite and cõmoditie by it, that now verelye
hereafter I shall doubt more of the effect and endes of good
thinges, then I did before.<br>
<span class = "speaker">HEDO.</span> It is for husbãd
menne too stande in doubt how farre the limittes and
merebãkes extend.<br>
<span class = "speaker">SPE.</span> And I cannot but muse styll,
yea, and wonder very muche, why ther hath been so great
controuersie in iudgementes vpon so weightie a matter (as
this is) emongist so well learned menne: especially suche as
bee most famous and auncient writers.<br>
<span class = "speaker">HEDO.</span> This was
euen the cause, where the verite of a thyng is playne and
manifest, cõtrarily, y<sup>e</sup> errour through
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>ignoraunce
againe in the same, is soone great &amp; by diuers meanes
encreaseth, for y<sup>t</sup> thei knewe not the foundation and first
beginnyng of the whole matter, they doo iudge at all
auentures and are very fondly disceaued, but whose sentence
thynke you too bee truest?<br>
<span class = "speaker">SPE.</span> Whan I heare
<span class = "roman">MARCVS Tullius</span> reproue the thyng, I then fãtasie none
of all their iudgementes, and whan I heare hym agayne
defende the cause: it maketh me more doubtfull thê euer I
was and am in suche a studie, that I can say nothyng. But as
I suppose y<sup>e</sup> Stoickes haue erred the lest, and nexte vnto
thê I commend the <span class = "roman">Peripatetickes</span>.<br>
<span class = "speaker">HEDo.</span> Yet I
lyke none of their opini<span class = "pagenum">|</span>ons so well as I doo the
Epicures.<br>
<span class = "speaker">SPV.</span> And emõgist all the sectes: the
<span class = "roman">Epicures</span> iudgement is most reproued and condemned
with the whole consent and arbitremêt of all menne.
<br>
<span class = "speaker">HED.</span> Let vs laye a side all disdayne and spite of
names, and admitte the Epicure too bee suche one, as euery
man maketh of hym. Let vs ponder and weighe the thyng as it
is in very deed. He setteth the high and principall
felicitie of man in pleasure, and thiketh that lyfe most
pure and godly, whiche may haue greate delectatiõ and
pleasure, and lytle pensiuenes.<br>
<span class = "speaker">SPV.</span> It is euen so.<br>
<span class = "speaker">HED.</span> What more vertuouser thyng, I praye you, is

Yea, but all menne wonder and crye out on it, and saye: it

<span class = "speaker">Hedo.</span> I knowe thei doo so,
but thei erre in y<sup>e</sup>
vocables of theise thinges, and are very ignoraunt of the
true and natiue significations of the woordes, for if wee
speake of perfecte thynges, no kinde of menne bee more
righter <span class = "roman">Epicures</span>, then Christen men liuing reuerêtly
towardes God and mã, and in the right seruice and worshiping
of Christ.<br>
<span class = "speaker">SPV</span> But I thinke the
<span class = "roman">Epicures</span> bee
more nerer and agree rather with the <span class = "roman">Cynickes</span>, then
with the Christien sorte: forsoth y<sup>e</sup> Christiens make them selues leane
<span class = "pagenum">|</span>with fastynge, bewayle and lament their
offences, and eyther they bee nowe poore, or elles theyr
charitie and liberalitie on the nedye maketh theim poore,
thei suffer paciently to bee oppressed of mêne that haue
great power and take many wronges at their handes, and many
men also laughe theim too skorne. Nowe, if pleasure brynge
felicitie wyth it, or helpe in anye wyse vnto the
furderaunce of vertue: we see playnly that this kynde of
lyfe is fardest from al pleasures.<br>
<span class = "speaker">Hedonius.</span> But doo

<span class = "speaker">SPE.</span> I like this saiyng well, but what doo

<span class = "speaker">HEDO.</span> If nothing bee more miserable

<span class = "speaker">SPEV.</span> Surely you gather the thing

<span class = "pagenum">|</span>I call that euyll, whiche dissolueth the

<span class = "speaker">SPV.</span> And
I suppose there bee verye fewe, but that thei bee offêders
in this thynge.<br>
<span class = "speaker">HEDO.</span> And in good soth I take it,
that al those y<sup>t</sup> bee purdged, are clere: whych wiped out
their fautes with lee of teares, and saltpeter of sorowfull
repentaunce, or els with the fire of charitie, their offêces
nowe bee not only smalle grefe and vnquietnes too them, but
also chaunce oftê for some more godlier purpose, as causing

<span class = "speaker">SPV.</span> In deede I knowe saltpeter and

<span class = "speaker">SPV.</span> What

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
